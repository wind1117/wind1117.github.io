Biography
=====
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Dalian University of Technology, working under the guidance of Pro. [Xin Yang](https://xinyangdut.github.io/). My research primarily focuses on computer vision, with a specific emphasis on addressing challenges related to common yet inconspicuous objects in our daily environment, such as glass and mirrors. My goal is to assist visual systems in overcoming the complexities posed by these often overlooked elements. I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions to enhance the capabilities of computer vision systems and contribute to the field's advancements.
